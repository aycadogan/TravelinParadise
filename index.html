    <article class="article-middle">
      <p>U.S. travel to Cuba is expected to rebound in 2019, according to a new survey released by the Center for Responsible Travel (CREST). The independent survey of U.S. tour operators and other service providers to Cuba shows that people-to-people travel, study abroad programs and cruise bookings are expected to rise this year after seeing declines in stayover travel in 2018. The findings come in the lead up to the 500th anniversary of Havana as the destination prepares for the expansion of its cultural programming and infrastructure.</p>
